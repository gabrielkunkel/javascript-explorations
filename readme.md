The purpose of this project was to seek out areas of JavaScript that I find confusing, hard, or just plain uncomfortable, and work with them until I got it good.

# Test-Driven Development

I love tests. Tests have liberated me to explore JavaScript playfully. It's tedious to
write console.log a dozen times with no record of what works and what doesn't.
In the sandbox of a spec file, I can see things play out the way I *expect*
them to - pun intended -- and deconstruct them when they don't. Armed with passed tests,
I can reason out the source of trouble and deduce a solution, like a Sherlock Holmes. 
Tests are invaluable for learning and development environments.

There is no central location for tests, here. Tests are named after the JavaScript file
they apply to with the '.spec.js' suffix.

# Free Code Camp Bonfires

I solved all of these without any assistance. I did not look at the solutions until I was able to solve them on my own. (I admit I should spend some time studying other solutions.)
At the beginning I struggled, so I took a break to study through The Little Schemer, by Daniel P. Friedman on the suggestion
of Douglas Crockford. I began to apply a "Scheme-Style" recursion strategy and found the algorithms quite fun and exciting.
As I explored other programming styles, including functional programming, I found these algorithm challenges to become
progressively easier.

Not all of these have tests. When I went back to add tests to the algorithms, and maybe develop them more, I found a few
of the challenges too simple to bother with. More tests to be added.

# Object-Oriented JavaScript

These are my notes while studying through Kyle Simpson's
*You Don't Know Js: This & Object Prototypes*. I had fun, not only following along,
but embellishing his examples and playing with them on my own, conforming them to
the behavior-driven test style.

I often used concepts from Learning *JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms* by Loiane
Groner from Packt Publishing to experiment with the concepts and see how I might use them
in a valid JavaScript pattern.


# Functional Reactive Programming

This is my work through http://reactivex.io/learnrx/. I deliberately avoided showing 
any of the answers before I could solve them independently. Tests gave me feedback
all along the way.

Not all of the exercises were true exercises. Some were pre-solved and the exercise was
just an example, but I often created a test for these and annotated them.
 
 Verbosity isn't a bad thing. A verbose, but well-written program is better than a short, badly written one. Nonetheless... A short, good program will always be best, if
 tenable. This is why I'm very grateful for the FRP paradigm.
 
 I look forward to incorporating functional reactive programming into my Angular and
  Node.js applications, and carrying these ideas over into Clojure when I get the 
 opportunity.
