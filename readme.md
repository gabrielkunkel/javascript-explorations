The purpose of this project was to seek out areas of JavaScript that I find confusing, hard, or just plain uncomfortable, and work with them until I got it good.

# Test-Driven Development

I love tests. Tests have liberated me to explore JavaScript playfully. It's tedious to
write console.log a dozen times with no record of what works and what doesn't.
In the sandbox of a spec file, I can see things play out the way I *expect*
them to (pun intended) and deconstruct them when they don't. Armed with passed tests,
I can reason out the source of trouble and deduce a solution, like Sherlock Holmes. 
Tests are invaluable for learning and development environments.

There is no central location for tests, here. Tests are named after the JavaScript file
they apply to with the '.spec.js' suffix.

# Free Code Camp Bonfires

I solved all of these without assistance. I did not look at the solutions until I was able to solve them on my own. 
At the beginning I struggled, so I took a break to study through The Little Schemer, by Daniel P. Friedman on the suggestion
of Douglas Crockford. I began to apply a "Scheme-Style" recursion strategy and found the algorithms quite fun and exciting.
As I explored other programming styles, including functional programming, I found these algorithm challenges to become
progressively easier.

Not all of these have tests. When I went back to add tests to the algorithms, and maybe develop them more, I found a few
of the challenges too simple to bother with. More tests to be added.

# Object-Oriented JavaScript

These are my notes while studying through Kyle Simpson's *You Don't Know Js:
This & Object Prototypes*. I had fun, not only following along,
but embellishing his examples and playing with them on my own, conforming them
to the behavior-driven test style.

I often used concepts from Learning *JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms* 
by Loiane Groner from Packt Publishing to experiment with the concepts and 
see how I might use them in a valid JavaScript pattern.


# Functional Reactive Programming

This is my work through http://reactivex.io/learnrx/. I solved all the answers
independently. Tests gave me feedback along the way. If there was an exercise 
I didn't understand, and consequently solved the wrong problem, I mentioned it
in the code and always tested my understanding by re-solving the problem from
the default state. 

Not all exercises were true exercises. Some were pre-solved and the exercise was
just an example, but I often created a test for these and annotated them.
  
I look forward to incorporating functional reactive programming into my Angular, 
React, and Node.js applications, and carrying these ideas over into other
languages, especially Java and Clojure which have their own FRP libraries.

# TypeScript Fun

While studying Java and anticipating an education in Angular 2, I became 
increasingly interested in turning my JavaScript into a statically-typed
experience so that I might, not only code with greater confidence,
but see the long-term bump in productivity that Andreas Stefik promises in his
lecture at StrangeLoop 2015, which you can find here at 
https://youtu.be/uEFrE6cgVNY?t=25m57s.

I like TypeScript. It compiles smoothly in WebStorm. I plan on using it
extensively for all my Js applications.
